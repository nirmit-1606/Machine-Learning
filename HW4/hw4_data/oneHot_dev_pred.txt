-	hawke 's film , a boring pretentious waste of nearly two hours does n't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny pathetic starving and untalented artistes
-	the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because seems obligatory
-	instead of trying to bust some blondes , diggs should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in movie this bad
+	a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to last
