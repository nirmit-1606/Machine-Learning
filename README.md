# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning evolves around a central question: How can we make computers to learn from experience and without being explicitly programmed? In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, accurate spam filters, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that everybody uses it dozens of times a day without knowing it.  
  
This course surveys the most important algorithms and techniques in the field of machine learning. The treatment of Math will be rigorous, but unlike most other machine learning courses which feature tons of equations, this version (Liang Huang's) focuses on the geometric intuitions and the algorithmic perspective.  

## Course Instructor

[Liang Huang](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~huanlian/) is a Professor of Computer Science at Oregon State University. His research areas are natural language processing and computational biology. During the COVID years, he applied natural language algorithms to RNA folding and RNA design to help fight the RNA virus with RNA vaccine, resulting in landmark papers in PNAS and Nature. He also enjoys teaching and has won a teaching award.
